## What is a Nanode

From the [Project:Nanode](https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Project:Nanode) page:
>Nanode is an open source Arduino-like board that has in-built web connectivity. It connects to a range of wireless, wired and ethernet interfaces. It allows you to develop web based sensor and control systems - giving you web access to six analogue sensor lines and six digital I/O lines. It costs under Â£20 as an easy build it yourself kit. Nanode was designed with Hacking in mind.

From the [Project:Nanode/Applications](https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Project:Nanode/Applications) page:
>Nanode is an Arduino like 8 bit microcontroller board with integrated Ethernet connectivity.
>It has 6 analogue sensing channels and 6 spare digital I/O lines.
>It can be used for a variety of web connected applications including remote control and monitoring, as a smart sensor, home automation, as a Tweeting device, and for publishing small amounts of data to the web.
>The existing software allows it to be set up as an I/O webserver - a device which sends the state of its analogue and digital I/O to a web page - and which can be controlled from that webpage.
>However it is not restricted to just that role, it can act as a publisher device and send data to an intermediary open data service such as Pachube, and it can act as a web connected I/O device, which subscribes to a Pachube data feed and acts according to the data received from that feed - for example setting its I/O, updating a display or controlling some actuator device.
